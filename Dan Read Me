The Unity file is just my unity project, although the assets file paths are from my computer soooo its not really all that useful, need to update it.
The Captures folder is somewhat more useful, sort of showing some of the simulation off, although this again is old footage.
The TP Link folder contains my C# code for communicating with a smart plug, i cant seem to get it to work within unity...
